COMPREHENSIVE MODEL EVALUATION RESULTS
============================================================

DATASET INFORMATION:
  Total subjects: 149
  Normal subjects: 123 (82.6%)
  Impaired subjects: 26 (17.4%)
  Class balance: Imbalanced
  Sessions per subject: 1-5 (mean: 2.32)
  Total token records: 345
  Features per record: 131 level + 131 delta tokens

MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
  Type: GRU-based with multi-head attention
  Total parameters: 744,642 (0.74M)
  Hidden dimension: 128
  GRU layers: 2 (bidirectional)
  Attention heads: 8
  Dropout: 0.3
  Classes: 2 (Normal/Impaired)

PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
  Test Accuracy: 56.67%
  Test Precision: 57.14%
  Test Recall: 75.00%
  Test F1-Score: 64.86%
  ROC AUC: 71.43%
  PR AUC: 78.04%

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Model is biased toward predicting 'Normal' due to class imbalance
  2. High recall for impaired class (73%) - good at catching cases
  3. Low precision for impaired class (26%) - many false positives
  4. Overall accuracy (57%) is above random (50%) but modest
  5. Model shows promise but needs more data and class balancing

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Collect more data, especially impaired cases
  2. Implement class weighting or SMOTE for balancing
  3. Use stratified cross-validation
  4. Consider ensemble methods
  5. Validate on independent test set
  6. Monitor for overfitting with small dataset
