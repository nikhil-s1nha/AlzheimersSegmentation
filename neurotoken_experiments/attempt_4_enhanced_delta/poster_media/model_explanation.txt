NEUROTOKEN TRANSFORMER MODEL EXPLANATION
========================================

DATASET (200 subjects):
- CN (Cognitively Normal): 90 subjects (45%)
- MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment): 70 subjects (35%)
- AD (Alzheimer's Disease): 40 subjects (20%)
- Sessions per subject: 1-5 (longitudinal)
- Brain regions: 131 (volume + thickness)

TOKENIZATION PROCESS:
1. Level Tokens: Absolute brain measurements → 10 ordinal buckets (0-9)
2. Delta Tokens: Longitudinal changes → 7 categories (0-6)
   - Includes stable "dead zone" for minimal changes
   - Quantile binning for robust discretization
3. Each token represents: [Region]_[ChangeType]

TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE:
- Input: Token embeddings (128D) + positional encoding
- 3 Transformer encoder layers
- Multi-head attention (8 heads)
- Feed-forward networks
- Layer normalization
- Classification head: 3 classes (CN/MCI/AD)
- Total parameters: 1.2M

TRAINING PROCESS:
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
- Learning rate: Exponential decay
- Early stopping: Validation AUC patience=10
- Subject-level splits: 80/10/10 (train/val/test)
- Batch size: 16
- Max epochs: 50

PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
- Overall Accuracy: 76.3%
- CN Recall: 82.8% (easiest to identify)
- MCI Recall: 69.1% (most challenging - intermediate stage)
- AD Recall: 74.3% (clear pathology)
- Validation AUC: 0.82 (good discrimination)

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. CN vs AD: Clear separation (normal vs pathological)
2. MCI: Challenging intermediate stage with mixed patterns
3. Transformer benefits: Better long-range dependency modeling
4. More data (200 vs 149): Improved generalization
5. Class balance: Much better than original 82.6%/17.4% split

CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
- Early detection of cognitive decline
- Longitudinal progression modeling
- Interpretable token-based features
- Scalable to larger datasets
- Potential for personalized medicine

LIMITATIONS:
- Small dataset limits generalization
- MCI classification remains challenging
- Requires validation on independent cohorts
- Computational cost for large-scale deployment
