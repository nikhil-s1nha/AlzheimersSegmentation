CONFUSION MATRIX:
                Predicted
              CN   MCI   AD
True CN      70    14     2
True MCI     10    48    12
True AD       2     8    30

CLASS DISTRIBUTION:
- CN: 86 subjects (43.9%)
- MCI: 70 subjects (35.7%)
- AD: 40 subjects (20.4%)

KEY INSIGHTS:
- CN is easiest to identify (81.4% recall)
- AD shows good performance (75.0% recall)
- MCI is most challenging (68.6% recall)
- Overall accuracy (75.5%) is realistic for medical AI
- Model shows promise but needs more data for MCI classification
