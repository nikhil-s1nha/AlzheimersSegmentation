# NeuroToken Experiments for Alzheimer's Detection

This directory contains three progressive attempts at implementing neurotoken-based deep learning for Alzheimer's disease detection using the OASIS-2 dataset.

## üß† Overview

We explore the concept of "neurotokens" - structured, region-specific quantitative descriptors derived from T1-weighted MRI images using FreeSurfer. These tokens include volumetric, thickness, and surface-based measurements for critical brain regions, processed through various neural network architectures.

## üéØ Experiment Details

### **Attempt 1: Multi-class Transformer**
- **Architecture**: Transformer encoder for multi-class classification (CN vs MCI vs AD)
- **Key Innovation**: First implementation of neurotoken concept
- **Results**: 50% accuracy, severe class imbalance issues
- **Limitation**: Model predicted majority class (CN) for most cases

### **Attempt 2: Binary GRU with Class Balancing**
- **Architecture**: GRU with attention mechanism for binary classification (CN vs Impaired)
- **Key Innovation**: Class balancing through downsampling + binary classification
- **Results**: 65% accuracy, 15% improvement over transformer
- **Limitation**: No temporal information utilization

### **Attempt 3: Temporally-Aware Hierarchical GRU**
- **Architecture**: Hierarchical GRU with session-level and subject-level processing
- **Key Innovation**: Explicit temporal modeling with session timing
- **Results**: 50% accuracy, 66.7% F1-score, 93.8% recall
- **Advantage**: Captures disease progression patterns

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Approach | Accuracy | F1-Score | Key Innovation | Dataset Size |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Transformer** | 50% | ~33% | Neurotoken concept | 150 subjects |
| **Binary GRU** | 65% | ~60% | Class balancing | 150 subjects |
| **Temporal GRU** | 50% | 66.7% | **Temporal modeling** | 149 subjects |

## üî¨ Research Significance

### **Attempt 1: Foundation**
- Established neurotoken concept
- Demonstrated feasibility of token-based MRI analysis
